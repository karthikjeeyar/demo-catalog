# Frontend Engineering Team

We are the core frontend team responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the user interface for **RHDH Plugins**. Our mission is to deliver high-quality, responsive, and intuitive experiences for the internal developer platform.

## 💻 Our Tech Stack
To maintain consistency and speed, we standardize on:
- **Framework:** React (TypeScript)
- **UI Component Library:** [Material UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/)
- **State Management:** React Query / Context API
- **Testing:** Jest & React Testing Library

## 🧩 Plugins We Maintain
We own the frontend lifecycle for the following RHDH experiences:
1. **Service Catalog Views:** Custom entity pages and search interfaces.
2. **Infrastructure Dashboards:** Real-time monitoring visualizations.
3. **Software Templates:** The frontend wizards for our Scaffolder tasks.

## 🛠 Working with Us
If you need a new UI feature or a custom plugin developed:
 **Step 1:** Check our [MUI Component Gallery](design-system.md) to see existing patterns.
 **Step 2:** Submit a **Feature Request** on our [Jira Board](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHIDP/issues/RHIDP-9368?filter=allopenissues).
 **Step 3:** For quick alignment, join our `#frontend-dev` Slack channel.

> ### 💡 Note on Design
> While we use MUI for speed and flexibility, we aim for "Red Hat-friendly" styling to ensure our plugins feel native to the RHDH environment.
